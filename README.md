A website where the user can search for any movie using the search bar. The user is presented with several movies which are called from the API and rendered onto the screen.

The user can click on any movie card which is presented to them and then another window pops up showcasing more information about the chosen movie.

The pop up screen presents a larger image of the movie along with the synopsis, country, release date, duration, genre, director, cast and ratings.
On the synopsis section the user has options to click on a view trailer button and/or add to favourites button.

When the user clicks on the view trailer button, a call to the YouTube API to get the requests for the trailer title is returned. The viewer can watch the trailer and decide if they would like to Add to Favourites button which will store their favourite movie in local storage.

When the user navigates to the Favourites page all their favourite movies are rendered from the local storage with an option to delete the movies if desired.
